# Rapid-kings-cup
A fast-paced, mobile-optimized drinking game using a 24-card "Power Deck" (A, 9-K). Built as a PWA for a standalone, full-screen experience with zero scrolling. Features strategic play like "The Hero" (J) and "The Shield" (Q). The game builds to a climax where the 4th King must drink the entire Center Cup!
