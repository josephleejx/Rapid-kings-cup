Project Name: Rapid King's Cup
Rapid King's Cup is a sleek, mobile-optimized adaptation of the classic social drinking game. Designed for speed and seamless play, it strips away the bulk of a standard 52-card deck to focus on a high-stakes, 24-card "Power Deck" (A, 9, 10, J, Q, K) that ensures the action never stalls.
Core Gameplay Mechanics
The Power Deck: A custom 24-card rotation designed to keep the game moving fast.
Tactical Rules: Includes classic mechanics with a twist, such as "The Hero" (Jack) who reverses play to save the next person, and "The Shield" (Queen), a strategic token players must activate before their turn to skip a drink.
The King’s Tax: The first three Kings build the "Center Cup," while the "Final Boss" (4th King) ends the game and forces the player to finish the pot.
Technical Features
PWA Ready: Built with mobile-app meta tags, allowing users to "Install" the game to their home screen for a full-screen, standalone experience without an address bar.
Mobile-First Design: Implements a strict 4x6 responsive grid that scales to any phone screen while blocking the "white box" viewport issues common in mobile browsers.
High Performance: Features smooth CSS3 3D-flip animations, interactive pop-up modals, and a built-in confetti engine for the game-over state.
Zero-Lag UI: A persistent Control Pane provides instant access to Pause and Restart functions without interfering with the game grid.
UI/UX Philosophy
The app prioritizes scannability and speed. Large card ranks, high-contrast suits, and bold typography ensure the game is playable even in low-light environments. The interface is locked via overscroll-behavior: none and fixed positioning to ensure the game feels like a native app rather than a scrolling website.
